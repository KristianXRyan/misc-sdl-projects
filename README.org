#+Title: Miscellaneous SDL projects

Various projects using C/C++ and SDL2. Usually things like simple games and
cellular automata.

* Compilation
In order to build the game you need a modern C++17 compliant compiler, 
preferably gcc. You will also need cmake, SDL2, SDL2_ttf, and SDL2_gpu.

To install these on Arch Linux, use:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell

sudo pacman -S cmake make gcc sdl2 sdl2_ttf

#+END_SRC

...and you can install sdl2_gpu via the [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sdl2_gpu-git/][AUR]].
