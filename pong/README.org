#+TITLE:  Pong

A rewrite of pong made with Rust.

This is an abysmal and terrible version of pong. It was merely meant to
be a 'Hello World' program for the language. 

* Building
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cargo build --release
#+END_SRC

You will also need to have a font called arial.ttf in the root
directory of the project.
